I'm an MPhil student in Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of Dr. José Miguel Hernández-Lobato. I'm interested in Bayesian deep learning, deep latent variable models, uncertainty in machine learning and information theory. I graduated from the University of Zaragoza in 2018 with a degree in Telecommunications Engineering (EE/CS). Bellow are links to some of my recent work.

## 2019 

**Uncertainty in Bayesian Neural Networks**\\
**J. Antorán** and E. Markou.\\
*To be presented at: Workshop on The Mathematics of Deep Learning and Data Science, The Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Cambridge.* 2019.\\
