## 2024

#### March

* Am visiting Scott W. Linderman at the University of Stanford. 

#### January

* I am once again organising the [Symposium on Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference](http://approximateinference.org) (AABI 2024), this time as programme chair.

* After a great time at Google, I returned to CBL as a Research Fellow.

## 2023


#### September


* I will be returning to Google Research as a research intern in the Cerebra team in September!

* I will be speaking at [Generative models and uncertainty quantification](https://genu.ai/2023/) in Copenhagen, September 20-21, 2023

#### July

* I will be at ICML 2023 next week and at the [5th Symposium on Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference](http://approximateinference.org) (AABI 2023) which will be co-located with ICML in Honolulu Hawaii, on Sunday July 23rd, 2023. I will be presenting the papers 

* The [I Cant Believe Its Not Better](http://icbinb.cc) movement's 2023 workshop proposal, for which I acted as an advisor, has been accepted to NeurIPS.

#### February

* I am co-organising the [5th Symposium on Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference](http://approximateinference.org) 
(AABI 2023) which will be co-located with ICML in Honolulu Hawaii, on Sunday July 23rd, 2023.


* I am back in Cambridge writing my PhD thesis and working on an exciting new project.

## 2022


#### September

* I joined Google Zurich as a Research Intern in the Cerebra team. I am working on source localisation and waveform synthesis, at the intersection of signal processing machine learning. 

#### August

* I will be speaking about Bayesian reasoning and giving a practical session on Bayesian Neural networks at the [Deep Learning Indaba](https://deeplearningindaba.com/2022/) in Tunis from the 21st to 26th of August. All prac materials are publicly available [here](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2022). The notebook for the Bayesian Deep Learning prac is here: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2022/blob/main/practicals/Introduction_to_ML_using_JAX.ipynb)

#### July

* I will be attending ICML 2022 in Baltimore USA. I will be preseting my papers [Adapting the Linearised Laplace Model Evidence for Modern Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.08900.pdf) and [Bayesian Experimental Design for Computed Tomography with the Linearised Deep Image Prior](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.05714.pdf). I will also be chairing the session on probabilistic methods and variational inference.

* Our workshop on [Understanding Deep Learning through Empirical Falsification](https://sites.google.com/view/icbinb-2022/home?authuser=0) has been accepted to NeurIPS2022. This workshop is part of the [I Cant Believe Its Not Better](http://icbinb.cc) movement.

#### February

* I will be joining the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](http://amlab.science.uva.nl) visiting Max Welling and Eric Nalisnick. 


## 2021

#### September

* I joined Microsoft Research in Cambridge as research intern in the [Azua team](https://github.com/microsoft/project-azua). 


#### June

* I joined G-Research as a quantitative research intern.


## 2019

#### July

* After an amazing year in Cambridge, I have joined the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk) withing the [Computational and Biological Learning Lab](https://www.cbl-cambridge.org) to pursue a PhD under the supervision of Professor José-Miguel Hernández-Lobato.

#### May

* Together with [Stratis Markou](https://github.com/stratisMarkou), I have released a library that implements most popular Bayesian Deep Learning methods: [github.com/JavierAntoran/Bayesian-Neural-Networks](https://github.com/JavierAntoran/Bayesian-Neural-Networks)

## 2018

#### October

* I have started the  [MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/course-highlights/2018-2019) at the University of Cambridge.

#### May
* I will be spending the summer at CERN developing telecommunications infrastructure for the ATLAS experiment.
